## Configuration File for TheOnionBox
## Latest Modification: 20170618 while preparing v4.0


[config]
## v4.0 will only support version = 2
protocol = 2


[TheOnionBox]
## Address of your Onion Box:
## This defaults to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces.
# host = 0.0.0.0
## If 'localhost', connections are limited to the local system.
# host = localhost
## Of course you may define a dedicated IP4 address as well.
# host = your.IP.4.address

## Port for the Web Server
## Defaults to 8080, which should be fine in most cases!
# port = 8080

## To define the lower threshold for the notification system:
## Messages (of the Box) with at least this level will be forwarded to the attached clients.
## Possible setting are DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR
## Defaults to NOTICE, case insensitive
## To 'DEBUG' or 'TRACE' the box you have to set the respective commandline parameters!
# message_level = NOTICE

## Per default, the Box operates at the root level of a domain e.g. http://localhost:8080/.
## If you intend to operate it (behind a proxy!) at a deeper level (e.g. @ http://my.server.com/theonionbox/)
## you have to define that base path here. You are not limited to a single path element.
## Please assure that this is an absolute filepath yet without the domain:port, beginning with a leading slash,
## no trailing slash, no quotation marks:
# base_path = /theonionbox

## The acceptable duration in seconds between two communication events of a client to the Box.
## If this duration is exceeded, the Box will expire the session. Default is 300 (seconds).
# session_ttl = 300
## Note: This is applicable for login procedures as well as monitoring activities.
## Note: The minimum duration accepted == 30, max == 3600. Values will be forced into that range.

## Shall we operate with SSL?
## Note: To actually make this running, you have to create a valid ssl certificate first:
## So run e.g.
## openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes
##
## DON'T distribute this combined private/public key to clients!
## (see http://www.piware.de/2011/01/creating-an-https-server-in-python/#comment-11380)
##
## ssl = yes    # deprecated 20170218
## Just set ssl_certificate & ssl_key to enable ssl mode!
## The file that holds the Certificate!
# ssl_certificate = server.pem
## The file that holds the Key!
# ssl_key = private_key.pem

## When a NTP server is provided
## we use it's time signal to compensate for the server's clock deviations
# ntp_server = pool.ntp.org
# ntp_server = fritz.box

## Tor ships with the GeoIPLight2 Country DB
## If you're interested in a more precise indication, you should install the GeoIP City DB
## e.g. from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ and define here the path to the db file.
## Both flavours (Full or Light) are supported.
# geoip2_city = path/to/geoip2/city/db.mmdb
## Be aware that you need to install python module 'geoip2' as well to access those information.


[Tor]
## How shall we establish the connection to your primary (controlled) Tor node?
## => via a ControlSocket (define additionally 'socket' parameter):
# control = socket
## => via a ControlPort (define additionally 'host' & 'port' parameter):
# control = port
## => via a Proxy (define a proxy via the [Proxy] section and set 'host' to an address reachable through this proxy):
# control = proxy
## Note: This defaults to control = port if not defined!

## Address of this Tor instance
## Do NOT use 'localhost' but 127.0.0.1 to connect locally
## Defaults to 127.0.0.1
# host = 127.0.0.1

## ControlPort of this Tor instance
## Default for a Relay (or Bridge)
# port = 9051
## Default for a TorBrowser
# port = 9151
## You may use 'default' (port = default) to test for 9051 (relay default) and 9151 (browser default)
# port = default
## Note: This defaults to port = default if not defined!

## ControlSocket of this Tor instance
# socket = /var/run/tor/control

## Timeout when connecting to Tor.
## Usually the connection should be established very quick;
## you may increase this if connecting to very remote systems.
# timeout = 5

## The Number of Seconds we keep the connection to
## Tor open after the last user disconnected.
## Hint: The minimum reasonable TTL is > 30(s)
## Defaults to 30 (seconds)
## eg. 1 day
# ttl = 86400
## eg. 1 hour
# ttl = 3600
## eg. forever
# ttl = -1

## Switches to preserve the messages of the Relay
## Up to 400 messages (total) will be preserved
## The severity of these messages can be defined here
## There's one switch for ERR, WARN & NOTICE
## The default setting is 'on' for all of these
## There's NO switch for INFO & DEBUG (as this would flood the memory without true value)
## Live - transmission of messages can be switched on/off in the client
# tor_preserve_ERR = no
# tor_preserve_WARN = no
# tor_preserve_NOTICE = no


[TorProxy]
## Note: Operation via a proxy given by a unix domain socket is (as of 04/2017) not supported!

## If you establish connection cookies for hosts to be controlled via the control center, there is the need
## to verify that those cookies are defined. To perform the verification, we need valid control port
## settings of the node acting as proxy:
## How shall we establish the connection to the node?
## => via a ControlSocket (define additionally 'socket' parameter):
# control = socket
## => via a ControlPort (define additionally 'port' parameter):
# control = port
## You may use control = default to operate with [Tor]control
## Note: This defaults to control = default if not defined!

## Address of the proxy to use
## Do NOT use 'localhost' but 127.0.0.1 to connect locally
## You may use 'default' (host = default) to use [Tor]host
# host = default
# host = 127.0.0.1
## Note: This defaults to host = default if not defined!

## Port for the proxy
## Default for a Relay (or Bridge)
# proxy = 9050
## Default for a Tor Browser
# proxy = 9150
## You may use 'default' (proxy = default) to test for 9050 (relay default) and 9150 (browser default)
# proxy = default
## Note: This defaults to proxy = default if not defined!

## ControlPort of the proxy Tor node
## Default for a Relay (or Bridge)
# port = 9051
## Default for a Tor Browser
# port = 9151
## You may use 'default' (port = default) to test for 9051 (relay default) and 9151 (browser default)
# port = default
## Note: This defaults to port = default if not defined!

## ControlSocket of the proxy Tor node
# socket = /var/run/tor/control
## You may use 'default' (socket = default) to use [Tor]socket
# socket = default
## Note: This defaults to socket = default if not defined!


#####
## Those are the Tor nodes to be controlled with the control center
## Note: You must not name any of the following sections 'config', 'TheOnionBox', 'Tor' or 'TorProxy'.


## Define one section per node:
# [myControlledNode]

## Alternatively: Beginning the section identifier with '#' indicates a nickname;
## if you later omit the 'nick' parameter, the nickname will be derived from the section identifier.
# [#myControlledNode]
## If you intend to define several ways to connect to this node,
## add whatever you like after a ':' to distinguish the sections:
# [#myControlledNode:2]

## Alternatively: You can use the fingerprint (with preceding '$') as section identifier.
## Ensure a length of 41 characters: '$' + fingerprint[40];
## if you later omit the 'fp' parameter, the fingerprint will be derived from the section identifier.
# [$5COOL5C30AXX4B3DE460815323967087ZZ53D947]
## If you intend to define several ways to connect to this node,
## add whatever you like after a ':' to distinguish the sections:
# [$5COOL5C30AXX4B3DE460815323967087ZZ53D947:2]


## How shall we establish the connection to this node?
## => via a ControlSocket (define additionally 'socket' parameter):
# control = socket
## => via a ControlPort (define additionally 'host' & 'port' parameter):
# control = port
## => via a Proxy (define a proxy via the [Proxy] section and set 'host' to an address reachable through this proxy):
# control = proxy
## Note: There is no default setting. If not defined, this section (and thus the node) will be ignored.

## IP Address of this Tor node
# host = 127.0.0.1
## You may as well define an onion or http address
# host = takeonionaddress.onion
## Note: There is no default setting.

## ControlPort of this Tor node
## Default for a Relay (or Bridge)
# port = 9051
## Note: There is no default setting.

## This is only relevant for very rare setups - yet if you like, you may use it!
## ControlSocket of this Tor node
# socket = /var/run/tor/control
## Note: There is no default setting.

## Hidden Service connections my be secured by definition of a authorization cookie.
## To operate via those connections, you may define this cookie here.
## For further details refer to 'HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient' on https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html
# cookie = xuseyourcookieherexTOB
## The Box will ensure that the cookie is registered before establishing the connection.
## Note: There is no default setting.

## The nickname of this node
# nick = myControlledNode
## Defining a nickname here overrides a nickname defined as the name of the section.
## Note: The Box is able to retrieve the nickname itself,
##       yet defining nickname (and fingerprint) parameters saves onionoo queries.
## Note: There is no default setting.

## The fingerprint of this node
# fp = $5COOL5C30AXX4B3DE460815323967087ZZ53D947
## Defining a fingerprint here overrides a fingerprint defined as the name of the section.
## Note: The Box is able to retrieve the fingerprint itself,
##       yet defining fingerprint (and nickname) parameters saves onionoo queries.
## Note: There is no default setting.
